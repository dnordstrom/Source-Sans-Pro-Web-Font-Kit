# Embedded WOFF Kit

## Source Sans Pro by Adobe

Source Sans Pro is embedded into the CSS file using data-uri's, for silky smooth inclusion into your projects. The kit contains all available weights, and italics.

To use the font, simply include the CSS file on your page (or copy the contents into your own stylesheet). The `font-family` is always `'Source Sans Pro'`, with proper numeric `font-weight`'s.

For production use, I recommend removing weights you don't use to reduce the size.
