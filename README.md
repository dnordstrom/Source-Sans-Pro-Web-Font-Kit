# Source Sans Pro, by Adobe
## Embedded WOFF Web Font Kit

Source Sans Pro is embedded into the `fonts.css` file using data-uri's, for silky smooth inclusion into your projects. The kit contains all available weights, and italics.

To use the font, simply include the CSS file on your page (or copy its contents into your own stylesheet). The `font-family` is always `'Source Sans Pro'`, with different numeric `font-weight`'s.
